Title: Simulating surface electromyographic (sEMG) and force signals
Version: 1.0
Authors: Eike Petersen <eike.petersen@posteo.de>
Description: Performs a high-fidelity simulation of surface EMG and force signals. Utilizes
  a comprehensive mathematical model of motor unit pool organization, surface EMG generation,
  firing instant stochasticity, and force generation. For details regarding the model, refer to
  Petersen and Rostalski (2019): "A Comprehensive Mathematical Model of Motor Unit Pool
  Organization, Surface Electromyography and Force Generation" (frontiers in Physiology).
